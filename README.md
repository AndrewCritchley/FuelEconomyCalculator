FuelEconomyCalculator

Fuel economy calculator designed to help people work out their fuel economy in MPG, L/100km or KPL based upon fuel pumped amount in either litres or gallons and distance travelled in miles of km. Unlike online calculators, this program will create a history file for all calculations done. This program was created mainly to learn and practise coding in C#.


To use this program, you will need to wait until your LOW FUEL warning light comes on, and at that point refuel as normal. When you refuel, reset your trip counter, and make a note of how much fuel in litres/gallons you put into the car. The next time your LOW fuel warning comes on, make a note of the miles/kilometres travelled on your trip counter. Now you can enter the distance travelled and amount of fuel put into the car into this calculator to work out either the MPG, L/100km or KPL between the two LOW FUEL warnings.

In the main menu, it will show the units of measurements expected next to each calculator option.
